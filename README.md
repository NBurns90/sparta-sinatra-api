# sparta-sinatra-api

For this homework I was required to build a web app using a live **API** using **Blizzard's API**.  The **API** was retrieved using the **HTTParty** gem and then parsed using the **JSON** gem and tested using the constructed tests to make sure that the data structure worked correctly and that all the tests passed.  I was also required to display this data in the web app in a readable format.

The tests carried out targeted specific parts of the API's data structure to make sure that everything there is correct and working.

# To Run The Tests

- Clone the repo using `git clone 'git@github.com:NBurns90/sparta-openweather-api.git`
- Open the file space in **Atom**
- Run `bundle` to install of dependancies
- To perform the tests type `rspec` in terminal

# To Run The app

- Follow the steps in the list above
- Run `rackup` to run the server
- Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:9292` (racking up may give you a different port, please check your terminal)
- From there you can navigate around the site
